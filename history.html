<h2>Family History</h2>

<p>
The roots of the Chettira Family trace back several generations in Kodagu,
where the ancestors were granted land in recognition of their service
and loyalty. These lands formed the foundation of the family’s social
and economic standing.
</p>

<p>
In the early 20th century, the family expanded into multiple branches
following traditional inheritance practices. Around the 1920s,
an oral partition divided ancestral properties among three main lineages,
leading to independent households.
</p>

<p>
Over time, portions of land were sold, redistributed, and reorganized
to meet changing family and economic needs.
</p>

<p>
Today, the Chettira Family continues to uphold its traditions, unity,
and values while adapting to modern education, professions,
and contemporary lifestyles.
