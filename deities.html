      <h2 class="page-title">Deities worshiped by Chettira Family</h2>

      <h3 class="subtopic-title">Chettira Okkathra Deva Kodpo</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Deva Kodpo</strong> is a revered ritual of the Chettira okkathra, performed annually to honor the family deities and ancestral spirits.
        It is a time of spiritual renewal, where family members come together to offer prayers, perform traditional rites, and seek blessings for the prosperity and protection of the lineage.
      </p>
      </p>

      <p>
        The ritual reinforces unity within the okka and strengthens the spiritual bond between the family, the deities, and nature.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subtopic-title">Deities Honored During Deva Kodpo</h4>

      <h4 class="subtopic-title">Naatha (Naga Devathe)</h4>
      <p>
        Naatha is revered as the serpent deity of the Chettira family land, enshrined specifically within their ancestral
        property. In Chettira tradition, Naatha is remembered as one of a pair of male-female naga devatas, guarding the
        family's roots and prosperity. He is seen as a powerful protector of water, fertility, and subtle energies connected
        to the soil of Chettira land. His grace is sought to keep the lineage free from obstacles, curses, and hidden dangers.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subtopic-title">Thaayi</h4>
      <p>
        Thaayi is worshipped as the motherly guardian deity of the Chettira family, whose shrine stands on their own land
        (close to the Guru Kaarana shrine). She is believed to embrace the entire lineage like a mother, nurturing children,
        blessing marriages, and protecting the continuity of the bloodline. Whenever the family faces emotional, health, or
        relationship challenges, they turn to Thaayi for strength and healing. Her presence is experienced as gentle yet firm,
        guiding the Chettira family towards unity and dharmic living.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subtopic-title">Chaundi</h4>
      <p>
        Chaundi, in the Chettira family tradition, is honoured as a fierce protector connected to the many divine forms of
        Lord Vishnu. Though her shrine stands in Chettira land and belongs to their lineage, her protective energy is believed
        to extend to all who approach with devotion and truthfulness. She is seen as a warrior-like deity who cuts through
        negativity, injustice, and evil influences around the family. Through her, the Chettira lineage feels safeguarded in
        times of conflict, transition, or unseen spiritual threats.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subtopic-title">Guliga</h4>
      <p>
        Guliga is worshipped on Chettira land as a powerful boundary and justice deity, whose shrine is rooted in their
        ancestral soil. He fiercely guards the family, the fields, and the sacred spaces associated with the Chettira lineage.
        Devotees believe Guliga responds strongly to sincerity and righteousness, punishing deceit and harmful intentions
        directed at the family. His worship reminds everyone that the land and lineage are under a vigilant, uncompromising
        protector.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subtopic-title">Korthi</h4>
      <p>
        Korthi is a localized guardian deity whose shrine exists within Chettira property, marking him as a special protector
        of their lineage. He embodies the spirit of courage, honour, and loyalty associated with the family's history and
        land. In times of conflict, uncertainty, or important decisions, the Chettira members seek Korthi's blessings for
        strength and clarity. His presence is felt as a shield around the family's dignity, name, and collective well-being.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subtopic-title">Paasanamurthy</h4>
      <p>
        Paasanamurthy is revered on Chettira land as a strong, stabilizing spirit deity whose shrine belongs
        exclusively to their family. Her energy is believed to bind and neutralize negative forces, curses, or disturbances
        that may threaten the lineage. The Chettira family turns to Paasanamurthy when situations feel heavy, blocked, or
        dangerous, trusting her to absorb and transform harmful influences. Like a solid stone foundation, she stands as a
        silent guardian ensuring the long-term safety and stability of the family line.
      </p>

      <p class="kicker">
        These rituals form the spiritual foundation of the Chettira family and guide the prosperity,
        protection, and continuity of future generations.
      </p>

      <p class="kicker">
        Note: While these particular shrines and deities belong to the Chettira family land, every family traditionally has
        its own chosen deity who specifically protects their lineage, history, and home.
