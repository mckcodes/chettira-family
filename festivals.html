          A record of village festivals and associated rituals observed by the Chettira Family.
        </p>

        <p>
          Naad Namme are traditional village festivals deeply rooted in Kodava culture and
          community life. These festivals are conducted to honor local deities and are marked
          by collective participation, rituals, and customary practices passed down through generations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Chettira Family actively participates in the following Naad Namme celebrated in and around
          the Karnangeri–Madikeri region.
